x(t)=A\sin(tf+p)e^{-dt} //equation for a dampened pendulum
/*
in which f represents frequency, p represents phase, A represents amplitude, d represents damping and t represents time.
If that pendulum can move about two axes (in a circular or elliptical shape),
    due to the principle of superposition, the motion of a rod connected to the bottom of the pendulum along one axes will be described by the equation
